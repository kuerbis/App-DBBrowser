=head1 NAME

C<db-browser> - Browse SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL databases and their tables interactively.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.035

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head2 SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL

    db-browser

    db-browser -h|--help

When the C<db-browser> is called with the argument C<-h|--help>, it shows a menu - see L</OPTIONS>.

=head2 SQLite

    db-browser [-s|--search] [directories to be searched]

If no directories are passed, the home directory is searched for SQLite databases.

C<db-browser> called with C<-s|--search> causes a new search of SQLite databases instead of using the cached data.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Search and read in SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL databases. With the C<db-browser> one can browse databases and their tables
interactively. The available DBI drivers are C<DBD::SQLite>, C<DBD::mysql> and C<DBD::Pg>.

To be able to browse database-, schema- and table-lists and the content of tables one needs to have the database
privileges required for fetching the respective data.

The C<db-browser> expects an existing home directory with read and write permissions for the user of the C<db-browser>.

It is recommended to work with an UTF encoding. Non mappable characters might break the output.

It is required a terminal with a width of at least 40 print columns.

Before the output leading and trailing spaces are removed from the elements and spaces are squashed to a single
white-space.

The elements in a column are right-justified if one or more elements of that column do not look like a number, else they
are left-justified.

See L<Term::TablePrint|Term::TablePrint/DESCRIPTION> for more details.

=head1 USAGE

The best way to find out how C<db-browser> works is calling C<db-browser>.

To be able to use all the features of the C<db-browser> some basic SQL knowledge is required.

=head3 SQL menu

The SQL menu is the menu which opens after a table was selected.

If C<AGGREGATE> or C<GROUP BY> is set, the C<SELECT> statement is automatically formed; a previous user defined
C<SELECT> statement is reset. A user defined C<SELECT> resets a previous set C<AGGREGATE> or C<GROUP BY> statement.

To reset a SQL "sub-statement" (e.g C<WHERE>) re-enter into the respective menu entry and choose C<'- OK -'>.

Changing the I<lock> mode (C<Lk0>,C<Lk1>) resets the entire SQL.

=head3 Keys to move around

=over

=item *

the C<Arrow> keys (or C<h,j,k,l>) to move up and down and to move to the right and to the left,

=item *

the C<PageUp> key (or C<Ctrl-B>) to go back one page, the C<PageDown> key (or C<Ctrl-F>) to go forward one page.

=item *

the C<Home> key (or C<Ctrl-A>) to jump to the beginning of the menu, the C<End> key (or C<Ctrl-E>) to jump to the end
of the menu.

=back

With the option I<mouse> enabled it can be used the mouse with the left mouse key to navigate through the menus.

To confirm a chosen menu item use the C<Return> key.

When choosing columns for the C<SELECT> and C<GROUP BY> statement, it is possible to select items with the C<SpaceBar>
key before C<Return> is pressed. Then the list of items marked with the C<SpaceBar> including the highlighted
item are added to the chosen items. If a mouse mode is enabled, it can be used the right mouse key instead of the
C<SpaceBar>. C<Ctrl-SpaceBar> (or C<Ctrl-@>) inverts the made choices - marked items are unmarked and unmarked items are
marked.

To move backwards in the menu hierarchy one can press the C<q> key . When prompted for a string, use C<Ctrl-D> instead
of C<q>.

=head2 OPTIONS

=head3 HELP

Show this Info.

=head3 Path

Shows the version and the path of the running C<db-browser> and the path of the application directory.

=head3 Colwidth

Columns with a width below or equal I<Colwidth> are only trimmed if it is still required to lower the row width despite
all columns wider than I<Colwidth> have been trimmed to I<Colwidth>.

=head3 DB Defaults

Set Database defaults.

The I<DB Defaults> can be overwritten for each Database with the Database menu entry "Database settings".

=head4 See if it's a number

If set to "YES", C<DBD::SQLite> tries to see if the bind values are numbers or not, and does not quote if they are
numbers.

See L<DBD::SQLite> for details. This is a SQLite-only option.

=head4 Enable utf8

If I<Enable utf8> is enabled, the utf8 flag will be turned on for character data coming from the database.

For a more driver specific explanation see the documentation of the respective Perl DBI driver.

With the C<Pg> driver in use it is available - apart from the "YES/NO" choices - also an "AUTO" choice. If the
L<DBD::Pg> version is less than 3.0.0, "AUTO" is mapped to "YES". For the meaning of "AUTO" look in
L<pg_enable_utf8|https://metacpan.org/pod/DBD::Pg#pg_enable_utf8-integer> for the value C<-1>.

=head4 "Binary Filter"

Print "BNRY" instead of arbitrary binary data.

If the data matches the repexp C</[\x00-\x08\x0B-\x0C\x0E-\x1F]/>, it is considered arbitrary binary data.

Printing arbitrary binary data could break the output.

=head4 Default DB dirs

Sets the default directories where C<db-browser> searches for SQLite databases. This is a SQLite-only option.

To move around in the directory tree select a directory and press C<Return> to enter in the selected directory or choose
"C< .. >" to move upwards. To add the current working-directory to the list of chosen directories use the "C< . >" menu
entry. To confirm the made choices select "C< = >". The ( "C< < >" ) menu entry resets the list of chosen directories if
any. If the list of chosen directories is empty, then "C< < >" goes back without changing anything.

This setting can not be overwritten in a single database.

=head4 RESET

I<RESET> resets the values of the database back to the "Database defaults".

=head3 DB Drivers

Choose the required database drivers.

=head3 DB Login

Determine when C<db-browser> asks for the login data:

=over

=item

per-DB

log in data is asked once per database.

=item

once

log in data is asked only once and then used for all connections.

=back

This option has no meaning if the SQLite driver is in use.

=head3 Enchant

Set the behavior of different menus.

For the menus "Choose Database", "Choose Schema" and "Choose Table" setting I<Enchant> to "Memory" means: save the menu
position.

For "Print Table" setting I<Enchant> to "Expand" means: enable printing the chosen table row.

For "Table Header" setting I<Enchant> to "Each page" means: print the Table Header on top of each page.

=head3 ENV DBI

- use C<DBI_USER> as username for all database logins.

- use C<DBI_PASS> as password for all database logins.

This option has no meaning if the SQLite driver is in use.

=head3 Lock

Set the default I<lock> value:

- Lk0: Reset the SQL-statement after each "PrintTable".

- Lk1: Reset the SQL-statement only when a table is selected.

=head3 Max Rows

Set the maximum number of fetched table rows. This can be overwritten by setting a SQL C<LIMIT> statement.

The fetched table rows are kept in memory.

To disable the automatic limit set I<Max Rows> to 0.

=head3 Metadata

If I<Metadata> is enabled, system tables/schemas/databases are appended to the respective list.

=head3 Mouse Mode

Set the I<mouse mode> (see L<Term::Choose/mouse>).

=head3 Operators

Choose the required operators.

With this menu entry it is possible to mark items with the C<SpaceBar> key.

=head3 Parentheses

Enable parentheses in C<WHERE> and/or C<HAVING TO> clauses.

- C<(YES>: the position of "(" in the menu is before the column names.

- C<YES(>: the position of "(" in the menu is after the column names.

=head3 ProgressBar

Set the progress bar threshold. If the number of fields (rows x columns) is higher than the threshold, a progress bar is
shown while preparing the data for the output.

=head3 Regexp Case

If I<Regexp Case> is enabled, C<REGEXP> will match case sensitive.

With MySQL the sensitive match is achieved by enabling the C<BINARY> operator.

=head3 Sssc Mode

With the I<Sssc> mode "compat" enabled back-arrows are offered in the SQL menus entries. In the "simple" mode it can
be used the C<q> key instead of the back-arrows.

=head3 Tabwidth

Set the number of spaces between columns.

=head3 Undef

Set the string that will be shown on the screen instead of an undefined field.

=head2 HINTS

=head3 Scalar functions

There is a hidden menu entry: selecting the prompt line in the SQL menu - I<Customize:> - makes available some scalar
functions.

=head4 Epoch_to_DateTime

=head4 Epoch_to_Date

=head4 Truncate

With SQLite the function C<TRUNCATE> is a user-defined function which returns stringified values.

    return sprintf "%.*f", $places, int( $number * 10 ** $places ) / 10 ** $places;

When comparing in C<WHERE> or C<HAVING TO> clauses with numbers, take the non-truncated (original) value for the
comparison if C<sqlite_see_if_its_a_number> is enabled (default).

Also to get a numeric comparison in an C<ORDER BY> clause use the non-truncated (original) values for the ordering.

=head4 Bit_Length

With SQLite the function C<Bit_Length> is a user-defined function which uses the Perl builtin C<length>. To make
C<length> return the number of bytes the C<bytes> pragma is C<use>d.

=head4 Char_Length

With SQLite the function C<Char_Length> is a user-defined function which uses the Perl builtin C<length> to get the
number of characters.

To remove a chosen scalar function from a column select the column with the function a second time.

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

See L<Term::TablePrint/REQUIREMENTS>.

=head2 Perl version

Requires Perl version 5.10.1 or greater.
