=head1 NAME

C<db-browser> - Browse SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL databases and their tables interactively.

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.999

=cut

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head2 SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL

    db-browser -h|--help

    db-browser

    db-browser [database-name, ...]

When the C<db-browser> is called with the argument C<-h|--help>, it shows a menu. The menu entry I<HELP> shows this
documentation - see L</OPTIONS>.

C<db-browser> called without arguments uses its own method to find the available databases. If the C<SQLite> driver is
in use, the option I<Search directories> determines where to search for C<SQLite> databases (defaults to the home
directory).

If C<db-browser> is called with arguments, the arguments are use as the available databases.

=head2 SQLite

    db-browser [-s|--search]

C<db-browser> called with C<-s|--search> causes a new search of SQLite databases instead of using the cached data.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Search and read in SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL databases. With the C<db-browser> one can browse databases and their tables
interactively. The supported DBI drivers are C<DBD::SQLite>, C<DBD::mysql> and C<DBD::Pg>.

To be able to browse the database-, schema- and table-lists and the content of tables the user must have the database
privileges required for fetching the requested data.

The C<db-browser> expects an existing home directory with read and write permissions for the user of the C<db-browser>.

Before the output leading and trailing spaces are removed from the elements and spaces are squashed to a single
white-space.

The elements in a column are right-justified if one or more elements of that column do not look like a number, else they
are left-justified.

See L<Term::TablePrint|Term::TablePrint/DESCRIPTION> for more details.

=head3 Legacy encodings

Non mappable characters will break the output.

=head1 USAGE

The best way to find out how C<db-browser> works is calling C<db-browser>.

To be able to use all the features of the C<db-browser> some basic SQL knowledge is required.

=head3 Keys to move around

=over

=item *

the C<Arrow> keys (or C<h,j,k,l>) to move up and down and to move to the right and to the left.

=item *

the C<PageUp> key (or C<Ctrl-B>) to go back one page, the C<PageDown> key (or C<Ctrl-F>) to go forward one page.

=item *

the C<Home> key (or C<Ctrl-A>) to jump to the beginning of the menu, the C<End> key (or C<Ctrl-E>) to jump to the end
of the menu.

=back

With the option I<mouse> enabled it can be used the mouse with the left mouse key to navigate through the menus.

To confirm a chosen menu item use the C<Return> key.

In some sub-menus it is possible to select more then one item before C<Return> is pressed; in such sub-menus the list of
items marked with the C<SpaceBar> key including the highlighted item are added to the chosen items when C<Return>
is pressed. If a mouse mode is enabled, it can be used the right mouse key instead of the C<SpaceBar>. C<Ctrl-SpaceBar>
(or C<Ctrl-@>) inverts the made choices - marked items are unmarked and unmarked items are marked.

To move backwards in the menu hierarchy one can press the C<q> key. When prompted for a string, try C<Ctrl-D> instead
of C<q>.

=head3 SQL menu

The SQL menu is the menu which opens after a table was selected.

If C<AGGREGATE> or C<GROUP BY> is set, the C<SELECT> statement is automatically formed; a previous user defined
C<SELECT> statement is reset. A user defined C<SELECT> resets a previous set C<AGGREGATE> or C<GROUP BY> statement.

To reset a SQL "sub-statement" (e.g C<WHERE>) re-enter into the respective menu entry and choose C<'- OK -'>.

Changing the I<lock> mode (C<Lk0>,C<Lk1>) resets the entire SQL.

=head3 Delete, Update and Insert

To get to the C<DELETE>, C<UPDATE> or C<INSERT INTO> statements select the prompt "I<Customize:>" in the SQL menu
 and then select the prompt "I<Your choice:>".

=head3 Scalar functions

The scalar functions can be reached in the main SQL menu and also in the C<DELETE> and C<UPDATE> SQL sub-menus by
selecting the prompt "I<Customize:>".

The available functions are:

=head4 Epoch_to_DateTime

=head4 Epoch_to_Date

=head4 Truncate

With SQLite the function C<TRUNCATE> is a user-defined function which returns stringified values.

    return sprintf "%.*f", $places, int( $number * 10 ** $places ) / 10 ** $places;

When comparing in C<WHERE> or C<HAVING TO> clauses with numbers, take the non-truncated (original) value for the
comparison if C<sqlite_see_if_its_a_number> is enabled (default).

Also to get a numeric comparison in an C<ORDER BY> clause use the non-truncated (original) values for the ordering.

=head4 Bit_Length

With SQLite the function C<Bit_Length> is a user-defined function which uses the Perl builtin C<length>. To make
C<length> return the number of bytes the C<bytes> pragma is C<use>d.

=head4 Char_Length

With SQLite the function C<Char_Length> is a user-defined function which uses the Perl builtin C<length> to get the
number of characters.

To remove a chosen scalar function from a column select the column with the function a second time.

=head2 OPTIONS

=head3 HELP

Show this Info.

=head3 Path

Shows the version and the path of the running C<db-browser> and the path of the application directory.

=head3 Output

=head4 Colwidth

Columns with a width below or equal I<Colwidth> are only trimmed if it is still required to lower the row width despite
all columns wider than I<Colwidth> have been trimmed to I<Colwidth>.

=head4 ProgressBar

Set the progress bar threshold. If the number of fields (rows x columns) is higher than the threshold, a progress bar is
shown while preparing the data for the output.

=head4 Tabwidth

Set the number of spaces between columns.

=head4 Undef

Set the string that will be shown on the screen instead of an undefined field.

On MSWin32 only single-byte character sets are supported when setting I<Undef>, I<user>, I<host> or I<port> with the
C<db-browser>. Edit the configuration files directly if multi-byte encoded characters are required for these settings on
a machine with 'MSWin32' OS.

=head3 Menu

=head4 Menu Memory

Set the behavior of the interactive menus:

- setting I<Config Menus> to "Memory" means: save the selected configuration menu position while entering in a config
sub menu.

- setting I<SQL Menu> to "Memory" means: save the selected SQL menu position while entering in a SQL sub menu.

- setting I<DB Menus> to "Memory" means: save the selected menu position in the database/schema/table menus while
entering in a sub menu.

=head4 Table expand

- setting I<Print Table> to "Expand" means: if C<Return> is pressed, the selected table row is printed with each column
in its own line.

- setting I<Table Header> to "Each page" means: print the table header on top of each page.

=head4 Lock

Set the default I<lock> value:

- Lk0: Reset the SQL-statement after each "PrintTable".

- Lk1: Reset the SQL-statement only when a table is selected.

=head4 Mouse Mode

Set the I<mouse mode> (see L<Term::Choose/mouse>).

=head3 SQL

=head4 Max Rows

Set the maximum number of fetched table rows. This can be overwritten by setting a SQL C<LIMIT> statement.

The fetched table rows are kept in memory.

To disable the automatic limit set I<Max Rows> to 0.

=head4 Metadata

If I<Metadata> is enabled, system tables/schemas/databases are appended to the respective list.

=head4 Operators

Choose the required operators.

There are two REGEXP entries: "REGEXP" matches case sensitive while "REGEXP_i" matches case insensitive.

With MySQL the sensitive match is achieved by enabling the C<BINARY> operator.

=head4 Parentheses

Enable parentheses in C<WHERE> and/or C<HAVING TO> clauses.

- C<(YES>: the position of "(" in the menu is before the column names.

- C<YES(>: the position of "(" in the menu is after the column names.

=head3 Database

=head4 DB Plugins

Choose the required database plugins.

=head4 DB Settings

I<DB Settings> are used as default database settings.

There is also in each database sub-menu the menu entry "Database settings". If these database specific parameter are not
set, the global (to the database plugin) I<DB Settings> are use instead.

=over

=item Login Mode

Determine how to gather the login data:

=over

=item

Ask

Ask for the data of a field when connecting to a database.

=item

Use DBI_....

Use the environment variable to connect if available else ask the user for the required data.

The name of the environment variable:

    $environment_variable = 'DBI_' . uc($name_of_the_field);


=item

Don't set

If a field is not required for a database connection one can select the entry I<Don't set> for that field. The field is
then not used for the database connection. For example if the field is "port" I<Don't set> could mean: form the
C<DBI> C<DSN> without the "port" entry.

=back

Possible fields could be "host", "port", "user", "password" and others.

It depends on the database plugin which fields are offered to set and whether the selections made by the user a considered.

=item Login Data

The entered data for a field is saved with the field in a configuration file. If the configuration file contains a field
with a defined value, the value is used for that field to connect instead to ask the user for the value.

It depends on the database plugin which fields are offered to set and whether the selections made by the user a
considered.

=item DB Options

All options in this sub-menu - apart the last one - are connection attributes. For the meaning of the different
attributes see the documentation of the DBI database driver.

Setting I<binary_filter> (the last item in the sub-menu) to C<1> means: print "BNRY" instead of arbitrary binary data. If
data matches the repexp C</[\x00-\x08\x0B-\x0C\x0E-\x1F]/>, it is considered arbitrary binary data. Printing arbitrary
binary data could break the output.

It depends on the database plugin which connection attributes are offered to set and whether the selections made by the
user a considered.

=item SQLite directories

This is a SQLite-only option.

Sets the directories where C<db-browser> searches for SQLite databases. Defaults to the home directory.

To move around in the directory tree select a directory and press C<Return> to enter in the selected directory or choose
"C< .. >" to move upwards. To add the current working-directory to the list of chosen directories use the "C< . >" menu
entry. To confirm the made choices select "C< = >". The ( "C< < >" ) menu entry resets the list of chosen directories if
any. If the list of chosen directories is empty, "C< < >" goes back without changing anything.

This setting can not be overwritten in a single database.

It depends on the database plugin if this setting is considered.

=item Reset DB

Reset database specific parameter to the global I<DB Settings>.

=back

=head3 Insert

These I<Insert> settings can also be set temporarily in the C<INSERT INTO> sub-menu by selecting the prompt
"I<Customize:>".

=head4 Input modes

C<INSERT>ing data into a tables - select the input modes:

=over

=item

Cols

It is prompted for each column.

=item

Rows

Enter a row at a time.

To parse the rows it is used C<Text::CSV>.

=item

Multirow

Enter all rows at once.

=item

File

Read the input from am file.

Supported file formats: CSV files and the spreadsheet formats supported by L<Spreadsheet::Read>.

=back

=head4 CSV parse module

Set which module to use for parsing text files or for parsing the "Multirow" input.

Files where C<-T $filename> returns true are considered text files.

If a file is not a text file, then it is always used C<Spreadsheet::Read> to parse the file regardless of this setting.

=over

=item

Text::CSV

The following csv options are used if L<Text::CSV> is chosen.

To decode the file it is used the I<CSV file encoding>

=item

Text::ParseWords

With L<Text::ParseWords> it is possible to use a regexp as delimiter - see the option I<T::PW: $delim>.

To decode the file it is used the I<CSV file encoding>

=item

Spreadsheet::Read

If L<Spreadsheet::Read> is chosen, the default settings from C<Spreadsheet::Read> are used.

C<Spreadsheet::Read> will use the first line of the file to auto-detect the separation character if the file is a CSV
file.

The following csv settings have no meaning when L<Spreadsheet::Read> is in use.

=back

=head4 CSV file encoding

How to decode csv files.

=head4 csv sep_char

Set the csv sep_char.

=head4 csv quote_char

Set the csv quote_char.

=head4 csv escape_char

Set the csv escape_char.

=head4 csv various

Other different csv options.

=head4 T::PW: $delim

C<Text::ParseWords>: set the delimiter (C<$delim>). Can be a regexp.

=head4 T::PW: $keep

See L<Text::ParseWords> for more information for the option C<$keep>.

=head4 File history

Set how many input file names should be saved. A value of 0 disables the file history.

=head2 CONFIGURATION FILES

The syntax of the configuration file names is C<"conf_${db_plugin_name}.json">. To find out the location of the
configuration files call C<db-browser -h> and choose I<Path>.

The data is saved in JSON format.

The global database settings are placed in the member called C<"*$db_plugin">. Database specific settings have its own
member named like the database itself.
With the C<SQLite> driver "database name" means the absolute path to the database file.

Sub-members (keys):

    SQLite:                                    mysql:                             Pg:
        sqlite_unicode              (0,1)           user                              user
        sqlite_see_if_its_a_number  (0,1)           host                              host
        binary_filter               (0,1)           port                              port
        directories_sqlite¹                         mysql_enable_utf8  (0,1)          pg_enable_utf8  (0,1,-1)
                                                    binary_filter      (0,1)          binary_filter   (0,1)

¹ only with the C<SQLite> driver: expects an array-reference as its value. C<db-browser> searches for SQLite databases in the
directories passed with this array-reference.

Examples

    conf_SQLite.json:                                           conf_mysql.json:

                                                                }

=head1 REQUIREMENTS

See L<Term::TablePrint/REQUIREMENTS>.

=head2 Perl version

Requires Perl version 5.8.3 or greater.

=head2 Decoded strings

C<db-browser> expects decoded strings.

=head2 Encoding layer for STDOUT

For a correct output it is required an appropriate encoding layer for STDOUT matching the terminal's character set.

=head2 Terminal

It is required a terminal that uses a monospaced font which supports the printed characters.

Also the terminal has to understand ANSI escape sequences. If the OS is MSWin32 C<App::DBBrowser> uses
L<Win32::Console::ANSI> which emulates an ANSI console for the C<db-browser>.

The terminal should have a width of at least 40 print columns.
